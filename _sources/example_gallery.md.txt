Below are some examples that show the functionality of pydna in real-world scenarios.

* [Example_Restriction](./markdown_notebooks/Example_Restriction.md): PCRing a gene out of the genome, and cloning into a vector using restriction and ligation.
* [Example_Gibson](./markdown_notebooks/Example_Gibson.md): Gibson assembly of _R. cellulolyticum_ genomic fragments into a plasmid, from the original Gibson assembly paper [doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1318](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1318).
* [Example_CRISPR](./markdown_notebooks/Example_CRISPR.md): Using CRISPR with homologous recombination to delete genes by making two cuts in the genome, and repair it with an oligo. Used in the industrially relevant _K. phaffi_.
