YEp24PGK
========

This script carries out the cloning project described in the first
example in the cookbook.

This script simulates the construction of the vector YEp24PGK_XK by
PCR amplification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae XKS1 (Genbank
Z72979) gene from chromosomal DNA using primer1 and primer3 and the
subsequent sub cloning of the PCR fragment in vector YEP24PGK
(Genbank KC562906) by ligation of vector digested with BglII and the
PCR product digested with BamHI as described in the Materials and
Methods section on page 4250 in:

Johansson B et al. (2001), Xylulokinase Overexpression in Two Strains
of Saccharomyces Cerevisiae Also Expressing Xylose Reductase and
Xylitol Dehydrogenase and Its Effect on Fermentation of Xylose and
Lignocellulosic Hydrolysate, Applied and Environmental Microbiology
