genocad.com seems still down

But I managed to download the supplementary files from the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925571).

I put them [here](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna/tree/py3dev/scripts/files_for_annotation_function) 

A number of sbol files seems to hold most or all of the data:

labhost_All.xml
labhost_Aspergillus_nidulans.xml
labhost_Bacillus_subtilis.xml
labhost_Drosophila_melanogaster.xml
labhost_Escherichia_Coli.xml
labhost_Gram-negative_bacteria.xml
labhost_Insect_Cells.xml
labhost_Kluyveromyces_lactis.xml
labhost_Mammalian_Cells.xml
labhost_Pichia_pastoris.xml
labhost_Plant_Cells.xml
labhost_Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.xml
labhost_Schizosaccharomyces_pombe.xml
labhost_Unspecified.xml

Looking closely, the labhost_All.xml should hold all of the features.

These seem to be the same as the ones I got by mail from Tim.

They contain this kind of element:

<component>
   <DnaComponent ns2:about="http://genocad.org/SBOL/doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.1159038/Part:AmpR_promoter-009">
     <ns2:type ns2:resource="so:0000167"/>
     <displayId>AmpR_promoter-009</displayId>
     <name>AmpR promoter-009</name>
     <description/>
     <dnaSequence>
        <DnaSequence ns2:about="http://genocad.org/SBOL/doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.1159038/Part:AmpR_promoter-009#seq">
           <nucleotides>cgcggaacccctatttgtttatttttctaaatacattcaaatatgtatccgctcatgagacaataaccctgataaatgcttcaataatattgaaaaaggaagagt</nucleotides>
        </DnaSequence>
     </dnaSequence>
    </DnaComponent>
</component>

Which seems to contain all that is necessary for describing a feature.

These files could provide a way to store pydna features, but what is the best way to use them.

A simple way would be to use a [sbol parser](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=sbol&submit=search)
and parse into Biopython SeqFeature objects and strings and then use some algorithm to match all features against 
a sequence, probably with a new method for the Dseqrecord class.

It might be overkill to pull in pySBOL as a dependecy for this as this is a wrapper around libSBOL which is C++.

There is snekbol which is pure python https://github.com/tjomasc/snekbol
