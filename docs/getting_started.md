# Getting started


The best way to get started is to follow our tutorial notebooks, you can find them in the
repository folder [docs/notebooks](https://github.com/BjornFJohansson/pydna/tree/main/docs/notebooks) and
are reproduced here so they can serve as documentation.

You can run the notebooks locally, but also on the browser using Google Colab, simply click in the badge of
the notebook to open it in Colab.

We recommend that you start in this order:

1. [Dseq](./markdown_notebooks/Dseq.md): Basic introduction to how sequences are handled in pydna.

etc.
