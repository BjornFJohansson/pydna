    "This page walks you through how to perform a PCR, and design PCR primers, using `pydna`. A PCR amplifies a specific stretch of DNA defined by the primers, and it is critical to ensure primer binding specificity and appropriate primer melting temperature (tm) through careful design. `pydna` provides tools for quick modelling of PCR to check for correct PCR products, and methods for calculating tm and primer design, as performed in other popular web servcies (e.g Primer3Plus). \n",

    "## Modelling PCR with Known Primers\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform PCR, `pydna` provides the `anneal` class and the `pcr` method to quickly generate expected primer products, on a `Dseqrecord` object. The `pcr` method needs only the forward and reverse primers, and the sequence. The primers must be passed from the 5' to the 3' end, following biological convention. More information on `Dseqrecord` and importing DNA sequences can be found in the other guide pages. \n",

    "The following example uses a 300+ bp custom sample circular DNA, containing an example gene that we would like to clone. 18 bp forward and reverse primers have been provided. "
