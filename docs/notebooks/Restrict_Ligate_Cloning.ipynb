    "Restriction enzymes recognise specific DNA sequences and cut them, leaving sticky ends or blunt ends. To cut a sequence using `pydna`, we can use the `cut` method on a `Dseqrecord` object. Here is an example showing how to use the `cut` method to genenrate EcoRI restriction digests. The record includes a 338bp circular sequence, with an example gene feature."
