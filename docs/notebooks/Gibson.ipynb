    "Gibson Assembly is a powerful method to assemble multiple DNA fragments into a single, continuous sequence in a seamless, one-step reaction. Developed by Daniel Gibson and colleagues in 2009, this method has been widely applied to work in molecular cloning, biotechnology, and synthetic biology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pydna` provides the `Assembly` class to simulate the assembly of DNA sequences. This page provides a guide to performing Gibson Assembly with pre-existing DNA fragments, followed by primer design for generating these fragments via the `pcr` method, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Assembly` class simulates Gibson assembly by searching for homologous sequence pairings. The `Assembly` class needs a list of DNA fragments, given in the datatype of `Dseqrecord` objects, and a minimum length of DNA (`limit` parameter)for which a sequence homology is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows how to create an `Assembly` object using multiple DNA fragments. Although the example below creates `Dseqrecord` objects for the sake of example, you can also perform assembly using real DNA records parsed as `Dseqrecords`. The bottom of the page offers another example from literature that applies real sequences."
